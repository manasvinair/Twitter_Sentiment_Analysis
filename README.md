This project classifies tweets as positive or negative using logistic regression. It applies natural language processing techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction.

Learning Experience-------->
>> Used Kaggle API to download datasets.
>> Preprocessed text by removing mentions, links, special characters, and stopwords.
>> Applied TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.
>> Trained a logistic regression model and optimized hyperparameters.
>> Learned to save and load models using pickle.


Next Steps------->
>> Improve accuracy using deep learning models.
>> Deploy as a web application using Streamlit or Flask.
